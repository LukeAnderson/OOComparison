#### Team of one: Luke Anderson
### Comparison Criteria

* [Language purpose/genesis](https://github.com/LukeAnderson/OOComparison/blob/master/1%20Language%20purpose%26genesis.md)
  * Why was the language created?
  * What problems was the language trying to address?
  * Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
* [Unique features of the language](https://github.com/LukeAnderson/OOComparison/blob/master/2%20Unique%20features%20of%20the%20language.md)
