# Properties
Getters and settersâ€¦write your own or built in?
Backing variables?
Computed properties?
***
#### Java
* Getters and setters must be written by the programmer they are not built into Java
* Java doesn't have any fancy syntax and code built into the language for backing variables and computed properities. If a programmer wants to implement aspects of these features then they will have to code them into Java's getters and setters themselves. Such as 
```Java
public class Dog{
    private String _age;
    public string getAge() { return _age; }
    public void setAge(int value) { _age = value * 7; }
}
```



#### C#
* Getters and setters can be auto generated by C#
    ```CSharp
        public string name{get; set;}
    ```
    The above is how you auto-implement properties in C#. Additionally C# can auto generate read only properties like so.
    ```CSharp
        public string name {get;}
    ```
    
* C# has backing variables. The backing variables provide a way for programmers to execute some code when someone tries to get/set a field. For example:
    ```CSharp
    public class Person{
        private int age;
        public int Age {
            get { return age;}
            set {
                if(value < 0 || value > 120)
                    throw new InvalidArgumentException("Invalid age");
                age = value;
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    So if one wants to set age they need to use the backing variable Age like so:
    ```CSharp
        Person person = new Person();
        person.Age = 22;
    ```
    If set age is invalid then it throws an exception as determined in the set portion of the backing variable.  
* C# can have computed properties just use any computation in the get/set section of the backing varibles and you are using computed properties. For instance if you wanted to return an age in dog years do `get return age * 7;` and this would be an example of a computed property.
