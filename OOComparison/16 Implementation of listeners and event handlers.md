# Implementation of listeners and event handlers
***
#### Java
* Listeners are implemented by implementing an interface. The interface ActionListener is standardly used to implement events. However, a programmer can also make their own interface to implement events.
```Java
public class Msger implements ActionListener{
    ...
    button.addActionListener(this);
...
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        System.out.println("button was pressed");
    }
}
```
#### C#
* C# has an EventListener class, which provides methods for enabling and disabling events from event sources. 
* C# handles events differently than Java. C# has delegates.
    * A delegate is similar to a function pointer in C. Programmers use delegate to encapsulate a reference to a method. Section 15) of this project goes into detail about C# delegates.
```CSharp
public delegate void EventHandler<TEventArgs>(
	object sender,
	TEventArgs e
)
```
The above code is the EventHandler delegate. It is used for handling events in C#. The `object sender` is the source of the event and the `TEventArgs e` is a type parameter that is the type of the event data generated by the event. 

Below is an example of a delegate being used for an event.
```CSharp
using System;
public class MyAlertDelegateClass {
    public delegate void AlertHandler(string msg);
    public event AlertHandler Alert;
        
    public void Process(){
        OnAlert("Alert!");
    }
    protected void OnAlert(string msg){
        if (Alert != null)
            Alert(msg);
    }
}
public class TestClass{
        static void Alerter(string s){
            Console.WriteLine(s);
        }
       public static void Main(string[] args){
 
            MyAlertDelegateClass alert = new MyAlertDelegateClass();
            alert.Alert += new MyAlertDelegateClass.AlertHandler(Alerter);
            alert.Process();

            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit.");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
}
```
The output will be as follows:
Alert!
Press any key to exit.
***
So the delagate worked through Main by calling Process which called OnAlert with parameter "Alert". Then in OnAlert since Alert != null it passed Alert the msg, "Alert" which got printed out.
