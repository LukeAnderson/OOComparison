# Language purpose/genesis
***
#### Java
* Java was created in order to fulfill a demand for reliability and accessibility. The Java virtual machine allows for Java to run on different devices at the cost of speed performance. Java was not designed to be a replacement for another language. Java was designed in part because C++ was not very reliable. Java was deigned with five primary goals in mind. These are as follows:
    * simple,object-oriented, and familiar
    * robust and secure
    * architecture-netural and portable
    * execute with high performance
    * interpreted threaded and dynamic

#### C#
* C# was created so that Microsoft would have their own version of an object-oriented language like Java. It was built off of C++. C# was designed with the following goals:
    * simple, modern, general purpose.
    * robustness, durablitiy, and promote programmer productivity
    * use for developing software components suitible for distributed environments.
    * portable

C# and Java share many of the same starting goals.
